# Senior Software Developer  
### AwareView Command and Control Software System

PerceptView builds real-world, production systems for situational awareness, sensing, and data processing.

Our systems live at the intersection of hardware, software, networking, and reality where:

- **Latency matters**
- **At-a-glance comprehension saves lives**
- **Systems must recover from failures**
- **Private network operation is the norm** — not cloud-based services

## THE ROLE

We are looking for a **Senior Software Engineer** who can design, build, and evolve complex systems with minimal supervision.

You will work across backend services, sensor and systems integrations, APIs, frontend components, and collaborate closely with a small team of developers.

You will work on **AwareView**, our in-house command and control software, to provide its operators awareness of the airspace our hardware is monitoring and protecting. This means ensuring sensor detections, video feeds, AI classifications, defeat resources, and other incoming information present a clear picture for operators under pressure to make rapid and accurate decisions.

This is **not** a “feature factory” role. This is a role for a senior developer who wants to work in various parts of the stack, can see the big picture, make efficient and clever decisions, and execute.

You will work with — and be supported by — a Software Architect with decades of experience and a penchant for thoughtful, robust, and maintainable code with quality error handling. Your documentation has (and will) evolve beyond “the code is the documentation” as you help your whole team and AwareView’s operators understand what you have created.

Your manager focuses on getting you what you need, asking clarifying questions, organizing priorities clearly, protecting your time, and getting out of your way.

**Work details:**
- **Location:** On-site strongly preferred; remote possible
- **Work week:** Monday–Friday, 40 hours, Mountain Time
- **Travel:** Likely, but occasional
- **Type:** Full-time employee or part-time contract

---

## WHAT YOU WILL DO

**Primary:** Software development for **AwareView**, our Command and Control software.

- Design and implement robust, production-grade systems with a clear understanding of trade-offs
- Take a big-picture view of system architecture and break it into executable plans
- Make technical decisions independently and explain them clearly
- Build systems that handle:
  - High I/O
  - Streaming data
  - Concurrent workloads
  - Offline (private network) operation
- Distinguish when code should be **parallel** vs **asynchronous**, and why
- Design for failure:
  - Log *why* something failed
  - Recover immediately when possible
  - Avoid brittle, cascading failure modes
- Integrate with third-party hardware, drivers, and lower-level system components
- Design, implement, and maintain REST APIs:
  - OpenAPI specifications
  - JSON Schema–driven validation
- Participate actively in technical discussions — asking questions early
- Occasionally work on frontend components (**Svelte 5**) without being expected to be a frontend specialist

You will be working on systems designed to save lives in the real world, in real time.  
This is **not** big tech.  
It **is** defense work.

## HOW YOU WORK

- Enjoy high trust, real challenges, and occasional nerd jokes

This role is **not** a good fit if you:

- Need constant direction
- Avoid cross-cutting system concerns
- Only want frontend or isolated backend work
- Get stuck when answers aren’t immediately available
- Only want to write “perfect” code
- Prefer lots of meetings
- Think testing is for “other people”
